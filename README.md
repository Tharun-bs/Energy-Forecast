# ðŸ’» Energy-Forecast
This project is a full-stack machine learning application designed to forecast energy consumption for both domestic and industrial settings using Facebookâ€™s Prophet time series model. It uses a Flask backend, HTML/CSS frontend, and synthetic data generated for training. 
# âš¡ Energy Consumption Forecasting App

A web-based application that predicts **domestic** or **industrial** energy consumption using Facebook Prophet, Flask, and synthetic datasets.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- Predicts daily energy consumption (kWh) based on user inputs.
- Handles both **Domestic** and **Industrial** usage types.
- Models trained using synthetic data via Prophet.
- Beautiful animated and responsive frontend using HTML/CSS.
- Easy-to-use date selector and categorical input form.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. **Synthetic Data Generation**  
   The `data.py` script generates synthetic energy consumption data for both domestic and industrial sectors.

2. **Model Training**  
   `df_energy.py` loads the generated CSVs, processes them, and trains two separate Prophet models which are serialized using `pickle`.

3. **Web Interface**  
   The `app.py` Flask app serves a web interface (`index.html`) that allows users to input variables like temperature, time of day, humidity, etc., and receive an energy forecast.
